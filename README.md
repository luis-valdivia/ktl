## Setup

Run `brew install pnpm` if you don't have pnpm(pnpm is faster than npm or yarn).

Run `pnpm i` to install the required modules.

Run `pnpm run dev` to start a local version. We use Vite for faster development so feel free to edit components as you go and see the changes happen live thanks to Hot Module Replacement.

Run `pnpm lint` to run the linter and lint as you go.

## Style Guide

Components follow the style of script/script-setup, then template, then style. We use Tailwind for quick styling.
